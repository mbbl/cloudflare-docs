You can control Aegis enablement on your zones via API. If you are not familiar with how Cloudflare API works, refer to [Fundamentals](/fundamentals/api/).

:::caution[Availability]
Cloudflare Aegis is available in early access to Enterprise customers. Contact your account team to request access.
:::

## Requirements

- The Aegis zone setting endpoint is only available within Cloudflare accounts that own leased IPs, or accounts to which a [BYOIP prefix](/byoip/) has been delegated. If you wish to use Aegis for zones that do not meet this criteria, contact your account team.
- Each Aegis pool can consist of either IPs from a BYOIP prefix or Cloudflare-leased IPs. A single dedicated egress pool cannot contain both BYOIPs and leased IPs.

## Steps

1. Contact your account team to get the ID for your dedicated egress pool.
2. Make a `PATCH` request to the [Edit Zone Setting](/api/resources/zones/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) endpoint:
- Specify `aegis` as the setting ID in the URL.
- In the request body, set `enabled` to `true` and use the ID from the previous step as `pool_id`.

```bash
--data '{
  "id": "aegis",
  "value": {
    "enabled": true,
    "pool_id": "<YOUR_EGRESS_POOL_ID>"
  },
}'
```
